This repository contains a series of projects through which I try to learn
programming language theory.

# Project list

* The first project is about [CoCo VM](http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CoCo/)
  which is a Python VM written in C++. From my experience, CoCo VM is well
  organized and suite for learning.

* The second project started before the first one finished. It is about writing
  a parser. I have no experience in writing a parser before. I am so confused
  by `PyParser` in CoCo VM.

* Compiler-1. A scheme compiler following
  [bootstrap scheme](http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction)
  but written in Python. (Actually, it is an interpreter.)
