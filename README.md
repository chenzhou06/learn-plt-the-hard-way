This repository is not a textbook teaching programming language
theory. Instead, it concludes many projects which try to record the
endeavor I made to write a language for myself.

The first project is about [CoCo VM](http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CoCo/)
which is a Python VM written in C++. I am taking a note analyzing its source
code, typing all code again by myself to force me not ignoring any details.
