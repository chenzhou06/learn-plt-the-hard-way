This repository is not a textbook teaching programming language
theory. Instead, it concludes many projects which try to record the
endeavor I made to write a language for myself.

The first project is about
[CoCo VM](http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CoCo/) which is a Python VM
written in C++. I will take a note analyzing its source code, type all
code again by myself to force me not ignoring any details.
