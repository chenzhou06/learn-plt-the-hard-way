This repository is not a textbook teaching programming language
theory. Instead, it contains many projects which try to record the
endeavor I made to write a language for myself.

The first project is about [CoCo VM](http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CoCo/)
which is a Python VM written in C++. From my experience, CoCo VM is well
organized and suite for learning.
